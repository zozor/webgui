Simple GUI toolkit with go

===========================
Install
===========================

go get github.com/zozor/webgui

The Idea
===========================

You import webgui and set "handlers" that can be called with javascript, after that you start the server.
webgui.SetHandler(handlername string, func([]byte) []byte)
webgui.StartServer(addr string) //usually localhost:34823 - or any other port

in index.html you use 

<script type="text/javascript" src="webgui"></script>

this loads jquery and the webgui function Communicate into the browser, which lets you call your handlers in go

Communicate(handlername, data, returntype, function(data))
-handlername: sends data to the handle with that name
-data: Can be either string og json object
-returntype: Can be whatever is used by $.ajax() in jquery. "text" or "json" are good choices for go.
-function(data): success function, data is the type specified in returntype

it also loads a ping function that makes sure the server is closed when the index.html page is not active anymore.

It's possible to use resource packing with

webgui.UseResource(files map[string][]byte)

if the client requests a file that does not exist, it looks in this map, before returning 404

Look at the examples to end confusion :)
